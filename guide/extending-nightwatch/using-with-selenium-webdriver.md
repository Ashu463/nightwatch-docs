### Using Nightwatch with the selenium-webdriver library

The [`selenium-webdriver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) NPM library is the official Node.js binding from the [Selenium project](https://www.selenium.dev/). 
Starting with **v1.5**, you can use it for scenarios where you need to extend the built-in commands or features of Nightwatch.

It is also possible to run tests exported from the [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/), with a bit of configuration changes. You can combine Nightwatch assertions with elements retrieved using the `selenium-webdriver` APIs. 

Here's how to do it:
1. record your test using the Selenium IDE (with the provided Chrome or Firefox extensions);
2. export the recorded test using the JavaScript Mocha export option; you do not need to change the Nightwatch runner, the default one also will work;
3. change the config as needed – at the very least you need to disable the Nightwatch session – see below for an example;
4. run the test using the nightwatch test runner

Full API documentation is available at the [Selenium API docs](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html) page.

### Example
The test below was recorded and exported using the Selenium IDE [Firefox extension](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) and modified with a few Nightwatch assertions being added.

<div class="sample-test">
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Generated by Selenium IDE
const { Builder, By, Key, until } = require('selenium-webdriver')
const assert = require('assert')
                                       
 describe('Selenium IDE Test', function() {
   this.timeout(30000)
   
   // The session is no longer managed by Nightwatch, but the geckodriver still is
   this.settings.start_session = false;
 
   let driver
   let vars
 
   beforeEach(async () => {
     const builder = new Builder()
       .forBrowser('firefox')
       .usingServer(this.settings.webdriver.url); // use the geckodriver started by Nightwatch
 
     driver = await builder.build();
   })
 
   afterEach(async function() {
     await driver.quit();
   })
 
   it('navigate to url', async function(nightwatch) {
     await driver.get("https://nightwatchjs.org/")
   })
   
   it('sampleTest', async function(nightwatch) {
     await driver.manage().window().setRect(1383, 1175)
     
     const element = await driver.findElement(By.linkText("Getting Started"));
     
     // By default, elements retrieved using the Selenium APIs have no selector property;
     // this is only used for output in Nightwatch assertions
     element.selector = 'By.linkText("Getting Started")';
     
     // The Nightwatch expect/assert APIs are now accepting elements retrieved using the Selenium APIs     
     await nightwatch.expect.element(element).visible;
     await nightwatch.assert.visible(element);
     
     // You can also use third-party assertion libraries; here the built-in assert library is used
     const textResult = await element.getText();
     assert.strictEqual(textResult, 'Getting Started');
     
     // Now the two options of clicking an element are equivalent    
     await element.click();
     //await nightwatch.click(element);
 
     // 4 | click | linkText=Home |  |
     // await driver.findElement(By.linkText("Home")).click()
   })
 })</code></pre>
