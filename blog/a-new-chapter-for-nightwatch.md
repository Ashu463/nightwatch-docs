Welcome to the new Nightwatch engineering blog where we aim to write about the latest updates and developments around the Nightwatch project, and also tutorials or other kinds of related articles.

Nightwatch was created back in 2014 as a framework which would enable you to write end-to-end tests very quickly and without headaches. We were guided by the belief that writing and running automated UI tests can and should be a straightforward and pleasant task, and should require as little configuration as possible. 

I’m confident to say that, as an open-source project, Nightwatch has entered a new major phase in its development and is now in a much better position to deliver on its promises.

### Nightcloud.io

But first... One of the main updates is that we have stopped developing the cloud testing platform – [Nightcloud.io](https://nightcloud.io). We've pulled the plug on it I'm afraid. This is due to various reasons but the main one is that we didn't see enough demand for it to justify the investment. We decided to focus on Nightwatch alone and try and make it the most sophisticated and user-friendly open-source testing framework out there.

### Community Updates

[BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com/) has recently announced their on-going commitment to support Open-Source by creating a new Program Office – a dedicated engineering team still part of the company, but only contributing to open-source software. More details can be found on [their blog](https://www.browserstack.com/blog/open-source-at-browserstack/).

If we want to make Nightwatch reclaim its game-changer status in the automated testing industry, we can hardly do it alone. I am happy to report that Nightwatch is one of the main projects to which the new Open-Source team at BrowserStack, led by core Selenium committer [David Burns](https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester), is contributing.

### Nightwatch V2

Nightwatch users will most likely find the upcoming v2 version pretty exciting. Work is already under way. We are completely reworking the transport layer to use the official [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) bindings for Node.js which means more seamless browser integration, better and more reliable DOM element handling, and overall more stable and faster tests.

Additionally, we are also working on other new features, APIs, and integration with other tools like Appium or Playwright.

### Tell Us Your Opinion

We would very much appreciate it if you’d take the time to fill in [this short survey](https://forms.gle/ahi2bTk7Kz4og8VK9) and tell us about features you are using or would like to see in the new version. Please do share it with your team.

Thanks for reading. Please make sure to [star the project](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch) on Github and also to follow us on Twitter; we're at [@nightwatchjs](https://twitter.com/nightwatchjs).
